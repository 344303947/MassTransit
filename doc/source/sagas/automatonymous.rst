Creating Automatonymous State Machines
======================================

Automatonymous_ is a state machine library built by the same team that created MassTransit. Automatonymous provides a friendly syntax for declaring a state machine, including the states, events (both trigger event and data events are supported), and behaviors. The simple syntax makes it easy to get started with your own state machines, while including many advanced features that make it extremely flexible in a variety of business contexts.

Like MassTransit, Automatonymous is free, open source, and licensed under the very permissive Apache 2.0 license, making usable at no cost to anyone for both commercial and non-commercial use.
